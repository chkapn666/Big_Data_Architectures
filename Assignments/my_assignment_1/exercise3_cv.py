# In this solution, we are going to utilize condition variables to tackle this challenge. 
# We will implement two condition variables, each of which will represent the awakening factor (aka the state 
# that allows a thread to execute its core function) for the pingers and the pongers, separately. 
# Using these two condition variables will lead to retaining two different queues. 

NITEMS = 30
buffer = 0  # when 0, we need a 'pinger' to 'ping'; when 1, a 'ping' message is printed and awaits for a 'ponger' to print 'pong'



# We are using one lock (mutex) to protect access to the shared buffer and two condition variables:
# - One condition variable for each type of thread, so we can wake up only the appropriate one (no wasted context switches).
# This improves performance and aligns with best practices in concurrent programming â€” threads should only be notified when they can safely proceed.
# The logic still enforces:
# - No 'Ping' unless the previous 'Pong' is done.
# - No 'Pong' unless there is a new 'Ping' first.
