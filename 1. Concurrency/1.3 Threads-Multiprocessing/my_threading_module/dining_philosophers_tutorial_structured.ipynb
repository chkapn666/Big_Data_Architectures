    "The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a **classical synchronization problem** in computer science. It models **resource allocation and concurrency** in multi-threaded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üîπ History and Importance**\n",
    "- Proposed by **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in **1965** as a study on **resource sharing and deadlocks**.\n",
    "- Demonstrates **issues of deadlock, starvation, and fairness** in concurrent computing.\n",
    "- Used in **operating systems, multi-threading, and distributed computing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üçΩÔ∏è Problem Definition**\n",
    "- **Five philosophers** sit at a circular table.\n",
    "- Each philosopher has **one plate** but needs **two chopsticks** to eat.\n",
    "- Chopsticks are **shared between adjacent philosophers**.\n",
    "- Philosophers have **two possible states**:\n",
    "  - **Thinking** ü§î: Not using chopsticks.\n",
    "  - **Eating** üçú: Must acquire **both left and right chopsticks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **‚ö†Ô∏è The Challenge**\n",
    "1. **Deadlocks** occur if all philosophers pick up their left chopstick at the same time, causing an infinite wait.\n",
    "2. **Starvation** happens if some philosophers never get access to chopsticks because others monopolize them.\n",
