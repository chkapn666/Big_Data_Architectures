    "# 🏛️ The Dining Philosophers Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📜 Introduction**\n",
    "The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a **classical synchronization problem** in computer science. It models **resource allocation and concurrency** in multi-threaded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 History and Importance**\n",
    "- Proposed by **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in **1965** as a study on **resource sharing and deadlocks**.\n",
    "- Demonstrates **issues of deadlock, starvation, and fairness** in concurrent computing.\n",
    "- Used in **operating systems, multi-threading, and distributed computing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🍽️ Problem Definition**\n",
    "- **Five philosophers** sit at a circular table.\n",
    "- Each philosopher has **one plate** but needs **two chopsticks** to eat.\n",
    "- Chopsticks are **shared between adjacent philosophers**.\n",
    "- Philosophers have **two possible states**:\n",
    "  - **Thinking** 🤔: Not using chopsticks.\n",
    "  - **Eating** 🍜: Must acquire **both left and right chopsticks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **⚠️ The Challenge**\n",
    "1. **Deadlocks** occur if all philosophers pick up their left chopstick at the same time, causing an infinite wait.\n",
    "2. **Starvation** happens if some philosophers never get access to chopsticks because others monopolize them."

    "# 🛠️ Solutions to the Dining Philosophers Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore **three different approaches** to solving the problem using **thread synchronization techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🔒 1. Using Locks (Mutex-Based Solution)**\n",
    "- **Each philosopher picks up one chopstick at a time using `threading.Lock()`**.\n",
    "- Prevents **race conditions** but can still **lead to deadlocks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🚦 2. Using Semaphores (Avoiding Deadlocks)**\n",
    "- **Uses `threading.Semaphore()` to regulate chopstick access**.\n",
    "- Helps **prevent deadlocks** but may still cause **starvation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **✅ 3. Using Conditional Variables (Fair Scheduling)**\n",
    "- **Uses `threading.Condition()` to ensure that a philosopher waits until both chopsticks are free**.\n",
    "- **Prevents deadlocks and ensures fairness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these solutions will be explained **with code and detailed explanations** below.\n"
