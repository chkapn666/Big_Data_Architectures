open 2 bash terminals

on the first one, do `python 2_socket_source.py` - now it will be waiting for a 
client speaking to that port in order to capture changes 

on the second one, do `cat myfile.txt | nc -lk 9999`

we can also send text data in real time by doing 
`nc -lk 9999`

and then just typing stuff
